# Image-Classification

In this notebook, I will attempt to classify images of three different sports. 

The image data set was obtained from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imbikramsaha/cricket-football-baseball

The data was split into training and test images with 20% of the data being tested.

In the analysis, I used logistic regression, as well as the Keras Tuner to create models for the neural networks.
